The explainations about my using function
    //hash function 1
    //Refer to the method of HashMap in JDK
    //Perturbation function : h = (hashCode>>16)^hashCode
    //then index = h & (mapSize -1)
    int calHash1(string key);

    //hash function 2
    //Using a simple method just likes this
    // int index = hashCode mod mapSize
    int calHash2(string key);

    //getting index with collision method 1
    //Use the chain address method,
    //e.x : so I need add a 'next' pointer in HashNode
    int collHash1(string key,int index);

    //getting index with collision method 2
    //An open address method is used,
    //rehashing by a series of fake random numbers is used to deal with collisions
    //e.x :I need to add a pointer to a random array in the HashMap
    int collHash2(string key,int index);


I just list the percent of every method like this.(currSize/mapSize)
    calHash1 and collHash1 : 144/256
    calHash1 and collHash2 : 2426/4096
    calHash2 and collHash1 : 101/256
    calHash2 and collHash2 : 2426/4096


Favorite quotes from mine:
    That plain little lad got lifted and taken away...
    
    You'll get rid of pants or bags!

    I'm figgering On you already know.

    Then again he bellowed and you know who's who.

    They were too smart to play.

    You only could before somebody lifted himself by Whisper-ma-Phone, for fun on your dad.

    That dares to come, or parties or what you so tame!
